## Project Overview

This console-based Java application simulates a **cinema seat booking system** for a fictional business called **Melbourne Cinema (MC)**. It allows users to:

- Book seats across various pricing categories
- Refund booked seats
- Print formatted booking and refund receipts
- Track seat availability and occupancy
- View a statistical sales report

---

## Technologies Used

- Java (Console application)
- OOP principles (encapsulation, method abstraction)
- JUnit 5 (for unit testing)
- UML class diagram design

## ðŸ§ª Unit Testing

- The `TestCinema` class uses **JUnit 5**.
- It covers 3+ methods with:
  - **2 valid test cases**
  - **1 invalid test case**
- Tested functions include:
  - `bookSeats()`
  - `refundSeats()`
  - `displayReport()`
